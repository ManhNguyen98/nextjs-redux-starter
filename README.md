**nextjs-redux-starter** is a beginner-friendly boilerplate to jumpstart your multilingual web application development. It's built using Next.js, Redux Toolkit, and i18n, providing you with a robust foundation to quickly create feature-rich projects.

## Features

- **Multilingual Support:** The starter template includes a pre-configured i18n setup, allowing you to easily create applications that can be translated into multiple languages. It comes with initial support for English and Vietnamese, but you can extend it to add other languages effortlessly.

- **State Management with Redux Toolkit:** Manage your application's state in a predictable and efficient way using Redux Toolkit. It includes a basic example of a counter using Redux, demonstrating how to integrate Redux into your Next.js project.

- **Routing and Layout:** The project follows Next.js conventions for routing, enabling you to create separate pages and a consistent layout easily.

- **Theme Switching:** Customize your user's experience by implementing a dark and light theme toggle feature.

- **Modern Development Workflow:** Whether you prefer npm or yarn, the project supports both package managers. However, yarn is set as the default option for a more streamlined development experience.

- **Code Quality and Consistency:** ESLint is integrated into the repository to ensure your code adheres to consistent coding standards, reducing bugs and enhancing maintainability.
